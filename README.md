## Notices

- Internet Archive cannot store videos. So any video tweet will be displayed by its text content.
- Internet Archive may not be able to save NSFW tweets.
- Currently, we don't properly handle retweets and replies (**You can contribute!**).
- Since July 1, 2023, Internet Archive is not able to save tweets, dues to Elon's new policy.
